# 2D Physics

This feature set contains primitive collider and rigidbody authoring tools, broadphase implementation and collision querying APIs, to enable work with physical collision detection in a DOTS environment. 

## Live example of the feature set

To see the feature set in action and allow for an easy testing ground, refer to the implementation of the missile hit detection system in the __TinySpaceship__ demo Project which is available from the [Project Tiny Samples ](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ProjectTinySamples)GitHub repo at the following filepath: ``[Root]/TinySpaceship/Assets/TinySpaceship/Scripts/Runtime/MissileHitSystem.cs``
